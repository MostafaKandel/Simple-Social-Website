<h3>Are you sure you want to delete this post?</h3>
<!--That is used to pass additional context to the template you want to load. See the docs
on the include template tag for details. We are basically loading the _posts.html template
 from within our current template and setting an object called post and hide_delete.
  We can then use post and hide_delete in the _post.html template (which we do).-->

	{% include "posts/_post.html" with post=object hide_delete=True %}

<form method="POST">
	{% csrf_token %}
	<input type="submit" value="Confirm Delete" class="btn btn-danger btn-large">
	<a href="{% url 'posts:single' username=user.username pk=object.pk %}" class="btn btn-simple btn-large btn-default">Cancel</a>
</form>
